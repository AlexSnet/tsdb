now:
  
  implement locking
  normalize exceptions

later:

  define 

maybe:

  allow chunks to be gzip'd?
  allow sub second steps?
  change indexing to be based on arbitrary index:
    would help with sub second steps
    define a base time and the define units for index
    eg. could use ms offsets instead of sec
