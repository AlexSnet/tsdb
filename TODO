now:
  
  implement locking
  normalize exceptions
  complete basic documentation

later:

  define aggregation functions
  make TSDBVar iterable

maybe:

  refactor chunk management to be done by ChunkManagers
  allow each variable to specify it's own ChunkMananger
  rename current chunk management to FixedSizeChunkManager
  implement variable size ChunkManager
  allow chunks to be gzip'd?
  allow sub second steps?
  change indexing to be based on arbitrary index:
    would help with sub second steps
    define a base time and the define units for index
    eg. could use ms offsets instead of sec
