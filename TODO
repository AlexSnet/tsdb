now:
  implement locking
  complete basic documentation

  make TSDBVar iterable -- started
  make sure doc tests work

maybe:

  convert metadata to JSON? or YAML?
  rename current chunk management to FixedSizeChunkMapper?
  implement variable size ChunkManager
  allow chunks to be gzip'd?
  allow sub second steps?
  change indexing to be based on arbitrary index:
    would help with sub second steps
    define a base time and the define units for index
    eg. could use ms or us offsets instead of sec
    (currently using seconds since the epoch)
